# consent-direct-web
Dotnet and web for this Proof-of-competence project

This works off the smart contracts that have been developed and tested here https://github.com/oliver-wood/consent-direct-poc

There will be three parts to the project:
* A simple React UI for an end-user to sign up to consent.direct. This will interact with the chain on the server using Nethereum
* A simple React UI for a data processor to register with the smart contract and add some consent questions
* A demo of integrating consent questions into a web sign up form

The aim is to get this up and running on the Ropsten testnet. This is no way intended to be something for use in the real World, it is merely a proof of my competence in this space in lieu of genuine commercial experience.
